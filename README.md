# Todo App with React JS and Golang
Simple todo app project built with React JS and Golang. <br/>
The goal with this project was to learn how to make a Rest api with Go. I choose the framework Fiber to achieve this. <br/>
I discovered the notion of pointer which is not directly present in languages like Python or JS.

## How to run the app
Open two terminals <br/>
In the first one, you're going to run the client
```
cd client
yarn start or npm run start
```
In the second one, you're going to run the server but before make sure you have installed the [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/dl/) on your computer 
```
cd server
go run .
```
